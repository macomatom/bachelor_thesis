Title: Webpage Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and datasets used in my bachelor thesis, which focuses on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training for text classification tasks. 
The project involves scraping, filtering, and processing data, extracting relevant attributes, and training deep learning models such as CNN and LSTM, as well as classical approaches like SVM with Bayesian optimization.

The structure of the repository reflects the full pipeline:

1_Data_Preprocessing – Filtering, lemmatization, and dataset preparation
2_Feature_Extraction – Extracting attributes from URLs and HTML content
3_Model_Training – Training and evaluation of machine learning models
4_Analysis – Initial data analysis and evaluation

For a detailed explanation of the methodology and results, you can find my full thesis in the Central Registry of Theses and Dissertations (CRZP): [https://opac.crzp.sk/?fn=detailBiblioFormChildOVIDK&sid=C03CB0FBA6588971D03D21D1B6BF&seo=CRZP-detail-kniha].
